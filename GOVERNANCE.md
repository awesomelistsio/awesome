# Governance Policy for Awesome Lists

This document outlines the governance model, decision-making process, quality standards, and long-term stewardship guidelines for the Awesome Lists project.

The goal is to ensure high-quality curation, maintain consistency across lists, and promote a healthy, sustainable open-source ecosystem.

## 1. Project Goals

The Awesome Lists project exists to:

- Curate **high-quality, domain-focused resources** across technology, science, digital culture, sustainability, and travel.
- Support **open knowledge**, **education**, and **community-driven learning**.
- Maintain a consistent ecosystem of well-organized, non-promotional, useful lists.

## 2. Roles & Responsibilities

### **2.1. Maintainer / Steward (Project Owner)**  

Responsible for the long-term direction and quality of the project.

Duties include:

- Reviewing and merging PRs.
- Maintaining consistency across all lists.
- Enforcing quality standards.
- Creating new lists where meaningful.
- Managing roadmap priorities.
- Rejecting low-value or self-promotional contributions.
- Updating governance and contribution rules as needed.

**Current Maintainer:** Brandon Himpfen (project founder)

### **2.2. Contributors**

Anyone submitting:

- Pull requests.  
- Bug reports.  
- New list proposals.  
- Resource updates. 

Contributors must follow the guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### **2.3. External Curators (Optional Future Role)**

Trusted maintainers of large subdomains (e.g., AI, Travel, Sustainability) may be appointed later.

## 3. Decision-Making Process

### **3.1. PR Review Workflow**

All pull requests are reviewed using these criteria:

1. **Quality** — Content must be meaningful, non-spam, and valuable.  
2. **Reputation** — Linked repositories should show substance (not vanity repos).  
3. **Relevance** — Must fit the list topic clearly.  
4. **Neutrality** — No self-promotion or commercial bias.  
5. **Consistency** — Must follow formatting conventions.

The maintainer has final discretion to approve or decline contributions.

### **3.2. Adding New Lists**

A new awesome list may be added only if:

- The topic has **a real ecosystem** (not niche for one product/company) 
- A GitHub repo already exists with meaningful content, OR  
- The topic is strategic and appears in the project roadmap  

Lists created solely to get listed will not be accepted.

### **3.3. Deprecation of Lists**

A list may be deprecated if:

- It becomes unmaintained for an extended period.  
- It becomes obsolete or redundant.  
- It violates Awesome List standards.
  
Deprecation steps:

1. Add a "Deprecated" notice.  
2. Archive or remove from index if necessary.  
3. Update roadmap accordingly.

## 4. Curation Standards

All entries must meet these criteria:

- **Non-promotional**  
- **Publicly accessible** (no paywalls unless necessary for books/courses)  
- **Meaningful resource count** — not empty or placeholder repos  
- **Stable maintenance** (recent updates or evergreen value)  
- **Clear descriptions**  
- **Follows awesome list conventions**  

## 5. Release & Update Process

- Updates are merged regularly as time permits.  
- Major reorganizations follow the roadmap.  
- New sections added gradually to maintain quality.  
- Quarterly review of all lists to ensure freshness.

## 6. Long-Term Stewardship

The project aims to:

- Grow slowly but **intentionally**.
- Prioritize **quality over volume**.
- Expand based on community demand and clear ecosystems.
- Support subprojects (e.g., AI, Travel, Sustainability) with depth.
- Avoid dilution by rejecting forced or low-value additions.

Maintained with care for the open-source community 💙.
