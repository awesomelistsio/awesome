# The Awesome Lists Manifesto [![Awesome Lists](https://srv-cdn.himpfen.io/badges/awesome-lists/awesomelists-flat.svg)](https://github.com/awesomelistsio/awesome)

[Awesome Lists](https://awesome.himpfen.com/) is a curated collection of high-quality, topic-specific awesome lists.  

Our mission is to promote clarity, accessibility, and usefulness across modern technical and scientific domains — from programming and AI to STEM and travel.

## Our Values

- **Curation Over Volume**  
  We believe in thoughtful, hand-picked resources, not endless link dumps.

- **Active Maintenance**  
  Lists should be living documents — regularly updated and maintained.

- **Transparency**  
  Descriptions should clearly explain why a resource is valuable.

- **Open Knowledge**  
  All lists should be openly licensed and accessible.

- **Practical Utility**  
  We prioritize resources that help people learn, build, or grow in their field.

## What Makes a List "Awesome"?

- Clear structure and purpose.
- Descriptive and helpful entries.
- Regular updates and maintenance.
- Neutral and objective tone (non-promotional).
- A focus on quality and usability.
